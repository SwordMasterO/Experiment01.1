Cookies, Analytics, and Advertising



<h2>Cookies </h2>

We and other parties may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels (also known as clear GIFs) to collect your data. A cookie is a small text file that web servers place on your device, designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. Cookies serve a variety of purposes, such as helping you navigate and interact with the Services, making your experience of the Services more relevant and personalized, helping us analyze use of the Services, saving your preferences, authenticating you, and enabling certain kinds of advertising. The cookies on the Services may be set by us (first-party cookies) or by third parties (third-party cookies). We may use session cookies (which are deleted when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your browser or device for longer). We may also use pixels in emails you receive from us to record actions such as whether you open an email or click a link in it. 

To adjust your cookie preferences generally, please consult the “Help” section of your browser for information about how to adjust your browser settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated or to block cookies altogether. Any preferences you have exercised in this way will only apply to the specific device/browser on which you made them, so if you want these preferences to apply when you access the Services from a different browser or device, you will need to make these preference choices in that specific browser or device. If you block or disable certain cookies, the Services may not function as intended and you may not have access to certain features or functions. Some cookies are strictly necessary for the Services to function, meaning that you cannot opt out of them. 

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”), please see the EEA/UK Privacy Notice below for more information about our use of cookies.



<h2>Analytics</h2>

We and third-party web analytics services, including Google Analytics, may use cookies and similar technologies on the Services for analytics purposes. You can find more information about Google’s analytics practices here. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here. Any preferences you have exercised through these methods will only apply to the specific device/browser on which you made them, so if you want these preferences to apply when you access the Services from a different browser or device, you will need to install the browser add-on or otherwise indicate your preferences in that specific browser or device.



<H2>Online Advertising</h2>

On the Services, we may allow third party cookies and third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google’s ad services) that use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant and targeted advertisements and other content to you on the Services and on other websites you visit and applications you use. These ads may be based on the content of the page you are visiting, automatically collected information, information you provide, and other information about you. These ads may also be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites, and may be tailored to your interests.



If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer or mobile browser to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out Link and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance's WebChoices Tool to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. For region-specific opt-out options, please see Supplemental Privacy Notice below. Please note that you may still see ads on the Services or ads for the Services on other websites or apps, but these ads may not be tailored to you. We do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using them or their continued availability or accuracy. Any preferences you have exercised through these methods will only apply to the specific device/browser on which you made them, so if you want these preferences to apply when you access the Services from a different browser or device, you will need to indicate your preferences in that specific browser or device.



Mobile App Advertising

You may receive tailored in-app advertisements when using our Apps or other mobile apps. We may use vendors or other parties to deliver ads on mobile apps or for mobile app analytics. The operating system of your device provides instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. Please review these instructions and/or your device settings for more information on how to control in-app advertisements. We have no control over how and to what extent your operating system allows you to control tailored in-app advertisements.



Do Not Track

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that is available in certain web browsers which you can learn more about here. We, like many other Services, do not currently recognize or respond to browser initiated DNT signals. Please note that DNT is different than the user “preference signal” referenced in the “Your Rights and Choices” section below, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your information for certain purposes, such as the “sale” of your information or the disclosure of your information for targeted advertising purposes, as defined under applicable laws.



How We Disclose Your Information

We may disclose the information we collect from and about you in the following ways:

Personnel. Our employees, contractors, and other personnel have access to your information as needed to provide the Services. 
Affiliates. Information you provide to one of our Websites or Apps may be disclosed to our other Websites and Apps. We may also disclose your information to our corporate affiliates (e.g., parent company, sister companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control), including Healthline Media UK.
Vendors. We may disclose or provide access to your information to vendors that provide services on our behalf, including website hosting, data storage, analytics, research, marketing and advertising, payment processing, security, data enrichment, content, contests and similar offerings, and other services. 
 Advertising. We may share certain data with Advertising platforms, such as Google and Social Networks such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Snapchat to allow us to target existing users and customers with highly relevant advertising campaigns. For the purposes of such campaigns. We may share a unique code (such as a hashed email address) with the applicable Advertising platform in order for that identifier to be matched against existing users of the relevant Advertising Platform and to identify potentially relevant audiences for targeted advertising. We may use services such as Google Ads’ Customer Match, LinkedIn Matched Audiences, ID5, LiveRamp, and Facebook Custom Audiences for these purposes.  
In addition to advertisements for our own goods and services, we may also facilitate third parties to advertise their own goods and services including by targeting those advertisements to those that might be most interested in them. These advertisements may be shown within our Services. In order to provide advertisements relevant to you, your IP address may be used, as well as your operating system and device type. Information about your particular device will be used to show you advertisements which work properly on that device. You may be able to adjust your preferences by visiting our Privacy Settings page or below in the 'Your Rights and Choices' section of this policy. To opt-out of advertising on a person-based level from ID5, please click here, and for LiveRamp, please click here.

Business transfers. In the event of a sale of some or all of our assets, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, including during negotiations of such an event, your data may be part of the transferred assets.
Legal compliance. We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or legal process, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with a legal obligation, (2) protect and defend the rights, property, or personal safety of ourselves, our personnel, users of the Services or the public, (3) obtain legal advice, or (4) protect against legal liability. This includes disclosures for fraud prevention.
With your consent. If you consent for us to disclose your information, we may do so consistent with your consent. You have the right to revoke consent at any time by emailing legal@rvohealth.com with the subject line “Revoke Consent” and explaining the information and disclosure(s) for which you want to revoke consent.
You may choose to post or otherwise provide information to the Services in such a way that other parties can view or access this information. For example, if you interact with the Services via social media platforms or use “social features” on the Services (e.g., Facebook plugins), such social media platforms may have access to information about you. If you participate in community forums, others may have access to information submitted or otherwise posted on those forums. Your choice to disclose information in these ways is not a disclosure of your information by us.

Your Rights and Choices

We may also need to retain certain information to comply with applicable law or exercise our legal rights.



We may need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to certain requests, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the type of request and the sensitivity of the information involved, verifying your [name and email address]. If provided in applicable law, you may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf.

Right to Opt Out of “Sales” and “Sharing”

If you are a resident of California and certain other jurisdictions, you may have the right to opt out of our “sale” or “sharing” of your information, which may be characterized by some laws as “targeted advertising.” As mentioned in the “How We Disclose Your Information” section above, we may provide your information to parties such as advertising providers and partners to, for example, provide you with more relevant ads offers that may be of interest to you. Under certain laws, these disclosures may be considered a “sale,” “sharing,” or “targeted advertising.”  



As discussed in the “Cookies, Analytics, and Advertising” section above, we may provide your information to advertising providers for purposes of targeted advertising, to show you more relevant and tailored ads, and to analytics providers that assist us in analyzing how you use the Services, our user base, and other matters. Under applicable law, the disclosure of your personal information to these parties to provide these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information, a “sharing” of personal information, or the processing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.



To opt out of our online disclosures of your information (such as through cookies and similar technologies) for purposes that could be considered a “sale” or “sharing,” please adjust your privacy settings in the Privacy Settings link on our website. To opt out of any other such disclosures, email us at legal@rvohealth.com with the subject line “Sale/Sharing Opt Out” and provide your name. In some jurisdictions, you may also opt out via a legally-recognized browser-based opt out signal.

Restrict our processing of personal data (i) if the processing is unlawful, (ii) if we no longer need to process the personal data, (iii) while we verify the accuracy of personal data when you have contested its accuracy, or (iv) when you object to processing based on legitimate interests.
To exercise any of your rights, please use the webform, toll free telephone number, or email address provided in the “Your Rights and Choices” section of this Policy.
